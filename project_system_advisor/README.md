Project : system tracking 

Description: 
> Use knowleage about Process , Signal to create a APP tracking CPU, MEMORY, ... and save 
    log file

Feature : 
> Tracking all process in a linux system about Cpu , Mem

> Tracking one or more process with specific PID which is set 

> Alert to User when system is overload

> Kill process which is overload 

> Log file for tracking in long time 

Skill :
> C programming
> Linux File System (/proc)
> Process 
> Signal 
> Binary Search Tree
> Function Pointer

Note:
> Log file certain name, cpu, mem, start/stop time of processes when they is overload

Organization 

	1. Project locate "main_project" directory
	
	2. The "module_test" folder which are a part of main project
		I create more small module look like then i intergrate them to bigger 
	
	3. the "test_case" directory contain code test( memory leak)

 How to run ?

	1.Go to "cd main_project"
	
	2.Run "make"

Test 2 feature:

	Feature 1 : tracking specific PIDs
	
		1.run : "./m 1"
		
		2.enter number pids tracking 
		
		3.enter each PID sequence 
		
		4.enter RAM limit ( percent)
		
		5.enter time out ( for alert, update node to tree)

	
	Feature 2 : tracking all processes on System

		1.run : "./m 2"

		2.enter RAM limit ( percent)

		3.enter time out ( for alert, update node to tree)
